## Getting Started (SSG)

> ATTENTION: You need to start the back-end first so the SSG can fetch the data from the API.

> For development, you need use `npm run dev` instead of `npm run build` and `npm run start`.

Run install script:

```bash
yarn install
```

Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the front-end project and follow the schema in the `.env.local.example`

After that, run the build script:

```bash
yarn build
```

And then run the start script:

```bash
yarn start
```
