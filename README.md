## Installation

```bash
$ yarn install
```

## Running the apps

1. Start the back-end

```bash
$ yarn start:backend
```

You can access the swagger documentation at http://localhost:3000/api<br>
You can access the back-end at http://localhost:3000

2. Put the back-end URL in the front-end `.env.local` file (see `.env.local.example`).

3. Start the front-end

```bash
$ yarn start:frontend
```

You can now access the front-end at http://localhost:3001

Maybe you will need to change the Next.JS port.
